## 💡 Key Takeaways

### Architecture Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns** - Keep layers independent
2. **Single Responsibility** - Each component does one thing well
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Reuse code effectively
4. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - Build what's needed now

### Development Best Practices
1. **Test Early and Often** - TDD leads to better design
2. **Document as You Go** - Future you will thank present you
3. **Optimize Later** - First make it work, then make it fast
4. **Security First** - It's harder to add security later

### AI-Assisted Development
1. **AI as a Partner** - Not a replacement for understanding
2. **Verify Generated Code** - Always review and test
3. **Iterative Refinement** - Improve prompts based on results
4. **Learn from AI** - Study the patterns it suggests
