# Module 11: Microservices Architecture

## 🎯 Module Overview

Welcome to Module 11 of the Mastery AI Code Development Workshop! This module focuses on designing and implementing microservices architectures using AI-powered development techniques. You'll learn how to decompose monolithic applications, design service boundaries, implement inter-service communication, and handle the complexities of distributed systems.

### Duration: 3 hours
### Track: 🟠 Advanced
### Prerequisites: Modules 1-10 completed

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Design effective microservice boundaries** using Domain-Driven Design principles
2. **Implement inter-service communication** patterns (REST, gRPC, message queues)
3. **Handle distributed transactions** using saga patterns
4. **Implement service discovery** and load balancing
5. **Design resilient systems** with circuit breakers and retry patterns
6. **Monitor and trace** distributed requests across services
7. **Use GitHub Copilot** to accelerate microservices development

## 📋 Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: Foundation - Service Decomposition (⭐)
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes  
**Success Rate**: 95%

Build your first microservices system by decomposing a monolithic e-commerce application into three services: User Service, Product Service, and Order Service. Learn the fundamentals of service boundaries and REST communication.

**Key Skills**:
- Service boundary identification
- RESTful API design
- Basic inter-service communication
- Docker containerization

### Exercise 2: Application - Real-World E-Commerce Platform (⭐⭐)
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes  
**Success Rate**: 80%

Implement a complete e-commerce microservices platform with advanced patterns including API Gateway, service discovery, event-driven communication, and distributed caching.

**Key Skills**:
- API Gateway pattern
- Event-driven architecture
- Service discovery
- Caching strategies
- Async communication

### Exercise 3: Mastery - Production-Ready Financial Platform (⭐⭐⭐)
**Duration**: 60-90 minutes  
**Success Rate**: 60%

Build a production-ready financial services platform with complete observability, security, resilience patterns, and distributed transaction handling using saga patterns.

**Key Skills**:
- Saga pattern implementation
- Circuit breakers
- Distributed tracing
- Security between services
- Performance optimization
- Chaos engineering readiness

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Review Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   cd module-11-microservices-architecture
   cat prerequisites.md
   ./scripts/check-requirements.sh
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-module-11.sh
   ```

3. **Start with Exercise 1**
   ```bash
   cd exercises/exercise1-foundation
   code .
   ```

## 💡 Copilot Tips for This Module

1. **Service Design**: Use comments to describe business capabilities before implementing
2. **API Contracts**: Define OpenAPI specs first, let Copilot generate implementations
3. **Error Handling**: Ask Copilot for resilience patterns specific to distributed systems
4. **Testing**: Request integration tests that handle network failures

## 📊 Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you'll have:
- ✅ Designed and implemented a microservices architecture
- ✅ Handled distributed system complexities
- ✅ Implemented production-ready patterns
- ✅ Used AI to accelerate microservices development
- ✅ Built observable and resilient systems
