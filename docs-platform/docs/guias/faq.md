# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to common questions about AI application development and this workshop.

## General Questions

### What is this workshop about?

This workshop teaches you how to build modern AI applications using cutting-edge tools and frameworks. You'll learn prompt engineering, RAG systems, agent development, and how to deploy production-ready AI solutions.

### Who is this workshop for?

This workshop is designed for:
- Software developers interested in AI
- Data scientists wanting to build applications
- Technical professionals exploring AI integration
- Anyone with basic programming knowledge wanting to learn AI development

### What are the prerequisites?

See our detailed [Prerequisites Guide](./prerequisites.md) for the complete list. In summary:
- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Familiarity with Git and command line
- A computer with internet access
- Curiosity and willingness to learn!

## Technical Questions

### What programming languages do we use?

Primarily **Python** for AI development, with some **JavaScript/TypeScript** for web interfaces. We also touch on:
- SQL for database queries
- JSON for configuration
- Markdown for documentation

### What AI models do we work with?

We cover:
- **OpenAI GPT models** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- **Claude** by Anthropic
- **Open-source models** via Ollama
- **Embedding models** for semantic search
- **Multimodal models** for vision tasks

### Do I need GPU access?

Not necessarily. We provide:
- Cloud-based solutions that don't require local GPUs
- Options for using CPU-only inference
- Guidance on GPU setup for those who want it
- Cost-effective alternatives for development

## Setup and Installation

### Why is my API key not working?

Common issues:
1. **Check formatting**: No extra spaces or quotes
2. **Verify permissions**: Ensure the key has necessary access
3. **Check credits**: Some APIs require prepaid credits
4. **Rate limits**: You might be hitting usage limits

### How do I fix "module not found" errors?

Try these steps:
1. Ensure you're in the correct virtual environment
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Check Python version compatibility
4. Clear pip cache: `pip cache purge`

### Why is my local model running slowly?

Possible reasons:
- **Hardware limitations**: Check CPU/RAM usage
- **Model size**: Try smaller models first
- **Configuration**: Optimize batch size and threads
- **Background processes**: Close unnecessary applications

## Development Questions

### How do I improve my prompt results?

Key strategies:
- Be more specific in your instructions
- Provide examples (few-shot learning)
- Use structured formats
- Iterate and refine based on outputs
- See our [Effective Prompts Guide](./effective-prompts.md)

### What's the difference between RAG and fine-tuning?

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**:
- Adds external knowledge dynamically
- No model retraining needed
- Easy to update information
- Lower cost and complexity

**Fine-tuning**:
- Modifies the model itself
- Requires training data and compute
- Better for specific behaviors
- More permanent changes

### How do I handle rate limits?

Best practices:
- Implement exponential backoff
- Use request queuing
- Cache responses when possible
- Monitor usage with logging
- Consider load balancing across keys

## Deployment Questions

### Where can I deploy my AI application?

Popular options:
- **Vercel/Netlify**: For frontend with API routes
- **Railway/Render**: Full-stack applications
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Enterprise solutions
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: AI-specific hosting
- **Docker**: Containerized deployments

### How do I manage costs?

Cost optimization tips:
- Use appropriate model sizes
- Implement caching strategies
- Monitor token usage
- Set up usage alerts
- Use open-source alternatives where possible

### How do I ensure security?

Security best practices:
- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Use environment variables
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate and sanitize inputs
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Regular security audits

## Learning Path Questions

### What order should I follow the modules?

We recommend the sequential order:
1. Fundamentals and Prerequisites
2. Prompt Engineering
3. Simple Applications
4. RAG Systems
5. Agent Development
6. Advanced Topics
7. Production Deployment

### How long does the workshop take?

- **Self-paced**: 4-6 weeks (few hours per week)
- **Intensive**: 1-2 weeks full-time
- **Workshop format**: 2-3 day intensive sessions

### What projects will I build?

You'll create:
- Chat applications with AI
- Document Q&A systems
- AI-powered APIs
- Multi-agent systems
- Production-ready applications

## Troubleshooting

### Where can I get help?

Resources available:
- [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md)
- Workshop Discord/Slack channel
- Office hours with instructors
- Peer study groups
- GitHub discussions

### What if I get stuck?

Recommended approach:
1. Check error messages carefully
2. Search the documentation
3. Try simpler examples first
4. Ask in the community with details
5. Take breaks and return fresh

### How do I report issues?

When reporting issues:
- Include full error messages
- Describe what you expected
- List steps to reproduce
- Mention your environment (OS, versions)
- Check if others reported similar issues

## Beyond the Workshop

### What should I learn next?
