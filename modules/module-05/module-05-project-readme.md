        # Generate D3.js visualizations
        # Create interactive dashboard
        # Show evolution over time
```

### Option 5: Custom Quality Rules Engine
Build a flexible system for defining and enforcing custom quality rules.

**Requirements:**
- DSL for defining quality rules
- Rule validation and testing
- Automatic fix generation
- Integration with CI/CD
- Team-specific rule sets

**Key Features:**
```yaml
# Custom rule example

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Project
Select one of the options above or propose your own idea that demonstrates Module 05 concepts.

### Step 2: Plan Your Architecture
```python
# Example architecture
project/
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── analyzer.py      # Core analysis logic
│   ├── metrics.py       # Quality metrics
│   ├── reporters.py     # Output generation
│   └── cli.py          # Command-line interface
├── tests/
│   ├── test_analyzer.py
│   ├── test_metrics.py
│   └── test_integration.py
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.md
│   └── api.md
├── README.md
├── setup.py
└── requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Implement Core Features
Start with the minimum viable product:

```python
# Minimal example
class YourQualityTool:
    def analyze(self, code: str) -> QualityReport:
        """Analyze code and return quality report."""
        # Parse code
        tree = ast.parse(code)
        
        # Calculate metrics
        metrics = self.calculate_metrics(tree)
        
        # Generate suggestions
        suggestions = self.generate_suggestions(metrics)
        
        return QualityReport(metrics, suggestions)

        code = filepath.read_text()
        tree = ast.parse(code)
        
        comments = []
        for rule in self.rules:
            violations = rule.check(tree)
            comments.extend(self._create_comments(violations))
            
        return comments
    
    def _create_comments(self, violations):
        """Convert violations to review comments."""
        return [
            ReviewComment(
                line=v.line,
                severity=v.severity,
