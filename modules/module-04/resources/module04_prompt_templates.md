# Prompt Templates for AI-Assisted Testing & Debugging

## üß™ Test Generation Prompts

### Basic Test Generation

```python
# Generate comprehensive unit tests for this function
# Include:
# - Normal cases with typical inputs
# - Edge cases (empty, None, boundaries)
# - Error cases that should raise exceptions
# - Performance test if applicable
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent, customer_type="regular"):
    """Calculate discount based on customer type and percentage."""
    # Implementation here
```

### Parameterized Test Generation

```python
# Generate parameterized tests using pytest.mark.parametrize
# Test all combinations of:
# - Valid and invalid inputs
# - Boundary values
# - Special cases
# Include descriptive test IDs for each case
def validate_password(password):
    """Validate password meets security requirements."""
    # Min 8 chars, 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 digit, 1 special
```

### Mock-Based Test Generation

```python
# Generate tests that mock external dependencies
# Mock:
# - Database calls (use Mock or MagicMock)
# - API requests (patch requests library)
# - File system operations
# - Time/datetime operations
# Verify all mock interactions
class EmailService:
    def send_welcome_email(self, user_id):
        # Gets user from DB, sends via SMTP
```

### Integration Test Generation

```python
# Generate integration tests for this Flask/FastAPI endpoint
# Test:
# - All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
# - Success responses with correct status codes
# - Error responses (400, 404, 500)
# - Authentication/authorization
# - Request validation
@app.route('/api/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET', 'PUT', 'DELETE'])
def user_endpoint(user_id):
    # Endpoint implementation
```

## üêõ Debugging Prompts

### Error Analysis

```python
# I'm getting this error:
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
# Stack trace: [paste full traceback]
# 
# This happens when calling this function:
def calculate_total(items):
    total = 0
    for item in items:
        total += item.price  # Error occurs here
    return total
#
# Fix the function to handle None values gracefully
```

### Performance Debugging

```python
# This function is slow when processing large datasets (>10000 items)
# Profile and optimize for better performance
# Consider:
# - Algorithm complexity
# - Unnecessary loops
# - Memory usage
# - Caching opportunities
def find_duplicates(data_list):
    duplicates = []
    for i, item in enumerate(data_list):
        for j, other in enumerate(data_list[i+1:], i+1):
            if item == other and item not in duplicates:
                duplicates.append(item)
    return duplicates
```

### Memory Leak Detection

```python
# This class seems to have a memory leak
# Analyze and fix any circular references or resource leaks
# Add proper cleanup methods
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.handlers = []
        
    def process(self, data):
        # Processing logic that might leak
```

### Race Condition Debugging

```python
# This code has race condition issues when used concurrently
# Add proper synchronization using threading.Lock or asyncio.Lock
# Ensure thread/async safety
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
    
    def increment(self):
        temp = self.count
        # Simulate some processing
        self.count = temp + 1
```

## üîÑ TDD Prompts

### Test-First Development

```python
# Using TDD, help me implement a BankAccount class
# Start with these test cases:
# 1. Create account with initial balance
# 2. Deposit increases balance
# 3. Withdraw decreases balance
# 4. Cannot withdraw more than balance
# 5. Cannot deposit/withdraw negative amounts
# 6. Track transaction history
# 
# First, generate the tests, then implement the minimal code to pass
```

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

```python
# I have this failing test:
def test_shopping_cart_apply_discount():
    cart = ShoppingCart()
    cart.add_item("laptop", 1000, 1)
    cart.apply_percentage_discount(10)
    assert cart.total() == 900
    
# The test fails with: AttributeError: 'ShoppingCart' object has no attribute 'apply_percentage_discount'
# 
# Implement the minimal code to make this test pass
```

### Refactoring with Tests

```python
# These tests are passing but the code is messy
# Refactor the implementation while keeping tests green
# Improve:
# - Code organization
# - Variable names
# - Remove duplication
# - Add type hints
def test_data_processor():
    dp = DataProcessor()
    assert dp.process([1,2,3]) == [2,4,6]
    assert dp.process([]) == []
    assert dp.process([-1,0,1]) == [-2,0,2]

# Current messy implementation:
def process(d):
    r = []
    for x in d:
        r.append(x*2)
    return r
```

## üìä Coverage Improvement Prompts

### Identify Missing Tests

```python
# This function has 60% test coverage
# Analyze and generate tests for the uncovered branches
# Coverage report shows lines 8-10, 15, and 22-25 are not covered
def process_order(order):
    if order.status == 'pending':
        if order.payment_verified:
            order.status = 'processing'
        else:
            # Lines 8-10 not covered
            order.status = 'payment_failed'
            send_payment_failure_notification(order)
            return None
    
    if order.items:
        for item in order.items:
            if not check_inventory(item):  # Line 15 not covered
                order.status = 'out_of_stock'
                break
    else:
        # Lines 22-25 not covered
        order.status = 'empty'
        log_empty_order(order)
        return None
        
    return order
```

### Edge Case Generation

```python
# Generate edge case tests for this function
# Consider:
# - Boundary values
# - Type variations
# - Null/None/empty inputs
# - Extreme values
# - Unicode/special characters
# - Concurrent access
def merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):
    """Merge two sorted lists into one sorted list."""
    # Implementation
```

### Branch Coverage

```python
# Improve branch coverage for this function
# Currently: 70% line coverage, 40% branch coverage
# Generate tests that cover all conditional branches
def calculate_shipping_cost(weight, distance, express=False, insurance=False):
    base_cost = 5.0
    
    if weight > 50:
        base_cost += 10
    elif weight > 20:
        base_cost += 5
    
    if distance > 1000:
        base_cost *= 2
    elif distance > 500:
        base_cost *= 1.5
        
    if express:
        base_cost *= 1.5
        
    if insurance:
        base_cost += max(10, base_cost * 0.1)
        
    return round(base_cost, 2)
```

## üîç Complex Debugging Scenarios

### Multi-threading Issues

```python
# This multi-threaded code produces inconsistent results
# Debug and fix thread safety issues
# Add proper synchronization
import threading

class SharedCounter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
        
    def increment_many(self, n):
        for _ in range(n):
            self.count += 1

# Test shows count is sometimes less than expected
def test_concurrent_increments():
    counter = SharedCounter()
    threads = []
    
    for _ in range(10):
        t = threading.Thread(target=counter.increment_many, args=(1000,))
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()
    
    for t in threads:
        t.join()
        
    assert counter.count == 10000  # Often fails!
```

### Async/Await Debugging

```python
# This async code hangs or times out
# Debug the issue and fix the async flow
# Ensure proper error handling
async def fetch_user_data(user_ids):
    results = {}
    
    async def fetch_one(user_id):
        response = await http_client.get(f"/users/{user_id}")
        return response.json()
    
    # This seems to hang with many users
    for user_id in user_ids:
        results[user_id] = await fetch_one(user_id)
        
    return results
```

### Database Transaction Issues

```python
# This code sometimes fails with database integrity errors
# Debug transaction handling and add proper rollback
# Ensure ACID properties
def transfer_funds(from_account_id, to_account_id, amount):
    from_account = Account.query.get(from_account_id)
    to_account = Account.query.get(to_account_id)
    
    from_account.balance -= amount
    to_account.balance += amount
    
    db.session.commit()  # Sometimes fails here
    
    # Send notifications
    notify_transfer(from_account, to_account, amount)
```

## üéØ Test Quality Prompts

### Improve Test Readability

```python
# Refactor these tests to be more readable and maintainable
# Use:
# - Descriptive test names
# - Clear arrange-act-assert structure  
# - Helper functions for setup
# - Better assertions with messages
def test_1():
    u = User("j", "j@e.c", "p")
    assert u.email == "j@e.c"
    
def test_2():
    u = User("j", "bad", "p")
    try:
        u.validate()
        assert False
    except:
        assert True
```

### Test Documentation

```python
# Add comprehensive docstrings to these tests
# Include:
# - What is being tested
# - Why it's important
# - Expected behavior
# - Any special setup/teardown
class TestPaymentProcessor:
    def test_successful_payment(self):
        # test code
        
    def test_declined_card(self):
        # test code
```

### Test Data Builders

```python
# Create test data builder pattern for these tests
# Reduce duplication and improve maintainability
# Use builder pattern or factory functions
def test_order_processing():
    order = Order(
        id=1,
        customer_id=123,
        items=[
            OrderItem(product_id=1, quantity=2, price=10.99),
            OrderItem(product_id=2, quantity=1, price=25.50)
        ],
        shipping_address="123 Main St",
        billing_address="123 Main St",
        payment_method="credit_card"
    )
    # More tests with similar setup...
```
