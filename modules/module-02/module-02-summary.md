# Module 02 Summary: GitHub Copilot Core Features

## üéØ Module Recap

You've mastered GitHub Copilot's core features through hands-on exercises that demonstrated:
- **Code Suggestions & Completions**: How Copilot generates and ranks suggestions
- **Multi-File Context**: Leveraging workspace awareness for consistent code
- **Pattern Recognition**: Using Copilot to maintain coding patterns
- **Context Optimization**: Maximizing suggestion quality through strategic context

## üîë Key Learnings

### 1. The Copilot Mental Model
```
Context ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Intent ‚Üí Generation ‚Üí Ranking ‚Üí Suggestion
   ‚Üë                                                      ‚Üì
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ User Feedback ‚Üê‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### 2. Context Window (~2048 tokens)
- **Active file**: Highest priority
- **Cursor position**: Surrounding code
- **Open files**: Additional context
- **Recent edits**: Pattern learning

### 3. Suggestion Types Mastered
- ‚úÖ Single-line completions
- ‚úÖ Multi-line blocks
- ‚úÖ Whole function implementations
- ‚úÖ Cross-file refactoring
- ‚úÖ Pattern-based suggestions

## üí° Top 10 Techniques

1. **Descriptive Naming**
   ```python
   # ‚ùå def calc(x, y):
   # ‚úÖ def calculate_compound_interest(principal: float, rate: float):
   ```

2. **Type Hints Always**
   ```python
   def process_orders(orders: List[Order]) -> Dict[str, OrderSummary]:
   ```

3. **Examples in Comments**
   ```python
   # Transform: "John Doe" -> {"first": "John", "last": "Doe"}
   def parse_full_name(name: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
   ```

4. **Progressive Building**
   ```python
   # Step 1: Interface
   # Step 2: Basic implementation  
   # Step 3: Add features
   # Step 4: Optimize
   ```

5. **Multi-File Context**
   - Keep related files open
   - Use split panes
   - Reference other files in comments

6. **Alternative Suggestions**
   - `Alt+]` = Next suggestion
   - `Alt+[` = Previous suggestion
   - Try at least 3 alternatives

7. **Context Priming**
   ```python
   # Context: Building a high-performance cache
   # Requirements: LRU eviction, thread-safe, TTL support
   # Pattern: Singleton with lazy initialization
   ```

8. **Custom Instructions**
   ```markdown
   # .copilot/instructions.md
   Always use type hints
   Follow PEP 8 strictly
   Include error handling
   ```

9. **Partial Acceptance**
   - `Tab` = Accept all
   - `Ctrl+Right` = Accept word
   - Type to modify inline

10. **Mode Switching**
    - **Inline**: Quick completions
    - **Chat**: Design discussions
    - **Edit**: Multi-file changes

## üìä Quick Reference Card

### Keyboard Shortcuts
| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Accept suggestion | `Tab` |
| Next suggestion | `Alt+]` |
| Previous suggestion | `Alt+[` |
| Dismiss suggestion | `Esc` |
| Trigger suggestion | `Ctrl+Space` |
| Accept word | `Ctrl+Right` |

### Prompt Templates
```python
# Functions
"Create a function that [task] with [constraints]"

# Classes  
"Design a class for [purpose] following [pattern]"

# Refactoring
"Refactor this to [goal] while maintaining [behavior]"

# Testing
"Generate tests including [scenarios] with [framework]"

# Documentation
"Document this with [style] including [examples]"
```
