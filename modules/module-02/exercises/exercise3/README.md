## üìù Instructions

### Part 1: Architecture & Custom Instructions

#### Step 1: Configure Copilot Custom Instructions
Create `.copilot/instructions.md`:

```markdown
# Custom Instructions for Analytics Dashboard

## Project Context
Building a real-time analytics dashboard with Python, focusing on:
- Performance and scalability
- Clean architecture patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type safety throughout

## Coding Standards
- Use type hints for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 strictly
- Write docstrings in Google style
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Add unit tests for all public methods

## Architecture Patterns
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Dependency injection for flexibility
- Event-driven architecture for real-time features

## Performance Requirements
- Sub-100ms response time for queries
- Support 10,000 concurrent connections
- Efficient memory usage with streaming
```

#### Step 2: Design the Architecture
Use Copilot Chat to help design:

**Copilot Chat Prompt:**
```
Based on the custom instructions, help me design a scalable architecture for a real-time analytics dashboard. Include:
1. Component diagram
2. Data flow
3. Technology choices
4. Scaling strategies
```

### Part 2: Core Implementation

#### Task 1: Data Ingestion Pipeline

1. **Create the streaming data processor**:
   ```python
   # In streaming_processor.py
   # Create an async streaming data processor that:
   # - Validates incoming data against schemas
   # - Handles backpressure
   # - Implements circuit breaker pattern
   # - Batches data for efficiency
   
   from typing import AsyncIterator, Dict, Any, List
   import asyncio
   from dataclasses import dataclass
   
   @dataclass
   class DataPoint:
       # Let Copilot suggest the structure
   ```

**Advanced Context Technique**: Open multiple related files:
- `schemas/data_models.py` - Data validation schemas
- `utils/validators.py` - Validation utilities
- `config/stream_config.py` - Configuration

This gives Copilot broader context for better suggestions.

#### Task 2: Analytics Engine

2. **Implement the analytics core**:
   ```python
   # In analytics_engine.py
   # Build a modular analytics engine with:
   # - Pluggable metric calculators
   # - Time-series windowing functions
   # - Statistical anomaly detection
   # - Machine learning predictions
   
   class AnalyticsEngine:
       """
       Core analytics engine with real-time and batch processing.
       
       This engine supports:
       - Custom metric definitions
       - Multiple aggregation windows
       - Anomaly detection algorithms
       - Predictive modeling
       """
       # Use detailed docstring to guide Copilot
   ```

**Context Optimization Tips**:
- Write detailed docstrings BEFORE implementation
- Include example usage in comments
- Reference design patterns explicitly

#### Task 3: Caching Layer

3. **Build multi-level caching**:
   ```python
   # In caching/cache_manager.py
   # Implement a sophisticated caching system with:
   # - L1: In-memory LRU cache
   # - L2: Redis distributed cache
   # - L3: Database query cache
   # - Cache warming strategies
   # - TTL and invalidation policies
   ```

**Custom Instruction Usage**: Reference your performance requirements in comments to guide Copilot's implementation choices.

### Part 3: Advanced Integration

#### Task 1: WebSocket Real-Time Updates

```python
# In realtime/websocket_server.py
# Create WebSocket server that:
# - Authenticates connections
# - Manages subscriptions to metrics
# - Implements efficient broadcasting
# - Handles reconnection gracefully

class RealtimeServer:
    """
    WebSocket server for real-time analytics updates.
    
    Features:
    - Topic-based subscriptions
    - Automatic reconnection
    - Message compression
    - Rate limiting per client
    """
```

#### Task 2: GraphQL API Layer

```python
# In api/graphql_schema.py
# Define GraphQL schema for flexible queries
# Support complex filtering, aggregation, and time ranges
# Implement DataLoader for N+1 query prevention
```

**Multi-Mode Copilot Usage**:
1. Use **Chat** for architecture decisions
2. Use **Inline** for implementation
3. Use **Edit** for refactoring across files

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests with Copilot
```python
# Let Copilot generate comprehensive tests
# In tests/test_analytics_engine.py

# Test anomaly detection with edge cases
# Include performance benchmarks
# Mock external dependencies
# Test error scenarios
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# Test complete data flow from ingestion to API
# Verify real-time updates work correctly
# Test cache invalidation scenarios
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
python tests/performance_tests.py

# Expected results:
# - API response time < 100ms (p95)
# - Throughput > 1000 requests/second
# - Memory usage < 500MB under load
```

## üí° Advanced Copilot Techniques

### 1. Context Priming
Before implementing complex features, "prime" Copilot with context:
```python
# Context: Building a time-series anomaly detector
# Algorithm: Isolation Forest with seasonal decomposition
# Input: Stream of DataPoint objects with timestamp and value
# Output: AnomalyResult with score and explanation
# Performance: Must process 10,000 points/second
```

### 2. Pattern Libraries
Create pattern files that Copilot can reference:
```python
# patterns/repository_pattern.py
class BaseRepository:
    """Standard repository pattern implementation."""
    # Copilot will follow this pattern in other files
```

### 3. Incremental Building
Build features incrementally with continuous context:
1. Start with interfaces/protocols
2. Add basic implementation
3. Layer in advanced features
4. Optimize with Copilot's help

### 4. Custom Instructions Evolution
Update `.copilot/instructions.md` as you learn what works:
- Add specific patterns that work well
- Include performance benchmarks
- Document architectural decisions

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

Your implementation is successful when:
- [ ] All components are fully integrated
- [ ] Real-time updates work smoothly
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met
- [ ] Code follows all custom instructions
- [ ] Comprehensive tests pass
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## üèÜ Mastery Challenges

For true mastery, implement these advanced features:

1. **Auto-Scaling Logic**: Implement automatic scaling based on load
2. **ML Model Integration**: Add a trained model for predictions
3. **Multi-Tenancy**: Support multiple isolated customers
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance

## üìä Metrics to Track

Document these metrics about your Copilot usage:
- Acceptance rate of suggestions
- Time saved vs manual coding
- Which contexts produced best results
- Most effective prompt patterns
