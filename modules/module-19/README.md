## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Tips for This Module

### Effective Prompts for Monitoring

1. **For APM Setup**:
   ```python
   # Create Application Insights instrumentation that:
   # - Auto-tracks HTTP requests and dependencies
   # - Captures custom metrics for business KPIs
   # - Implements sampling for cost control
   # - Includes correlation headers
   ```

2. **For Log Aggregation**:
   ```python
   # Implement structured logging with:
   # - Correlation IDs across services
   # - Log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   # - JSON format for easy parsing
   # - Automatic PII redaction
   ```

3. **For Dashboard Creation**:
   ```python
   # Generate KQL query for dashboard showing:
   # - Request success rate by endpoint
   # - P95 latency trends
   # - Error rate with drill-down
   # - Resource utilization metrics
   ```

## 📊 Success Metrics

You'll know you've mastered this module when you can:

- ✅ Detect and diagnose issues in < 5 minutes
- ✅ Track custom business metrics automatically
- ✅ Build dashboards that tell a story
- ✅ Implement proactive alerting with < 1% false positives
- ✅ Optimize monitoring costs by 30% or more
- ✅ Create self-documenting observability systems
