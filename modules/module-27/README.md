## 📚 What is COBOL Modernization?

COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) powers critical systems in:
- **Banking**: 95% of ATM transactions
- **Government**: Tax and social security systems
- **Insurance**: Policy management and claims
- **Retail**: Inventory and supply chain

### Why Modernize?

- **Maintenance Costs**: COBOL developers are retiring
- **Integration Challenges**: Difficult to connect with modern systems
- **Innovation Barriers**: Hard to add new features
- **Compliance**: Modern security and regulatory requirements
- **AI Opportunities**: Enhance with predictive analytics and automation

### Modernization Strategies

1. **Rehosting** (Lift & Shift)
   - Move COBOL to cloud
   - Minimal code changes
   - Quick wins

2. **Refactoring**
   - Restructure code
   - Improve maintainability
   - Preserve logic

3. **Rearchitecting**
   - Transform to microservices
   - API-first approach
   - Event-driven design

4. **Rebuilding**
   - Complete rewrite
   - Modern languages
   - AI-native design
