## üìã Implementation Guidelines

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 hours)
Use Copilot to help you:
1. Design the architecture
2. Create core models and interfaces
3. Set up project structure
4. Implement basic analyzers

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (2 hours)
Leverage Copilot's capabilities for:
1. Complex pattern detection
2. Multi-file analysis
3. Suggestion generation
4. Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Polish & Deploy (1 hour)
1. Create comprehensive tests
2. Add documentation
3. Package for distribution
4. Create demo scenarios

## üé® Suggested Architecture

```python
# Example structure to get started
# Let Copilot help you expand this

from typing import List, Dict, Protocol
from dataclasses import dataclass
from pathlib import Path

@dataclass
class CodeIssue:
    """Represents a code quality issue."""
    file_path: Path
    line_number: int
    issue_type: str
    severity: str  # 'info', 'warning', 'error'
    message: str
    suggestion: str

class Analyzer(Protocol):
    """Protocol for all code analyzers."""
    def analyze(self, file_content: str) -> List[CodeIssue]:
        """Analyze code and return issues."""
        ...

class CodeReviewAssistant:
    """Main class orchestrating the review process."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.analyzers: List[Analyzer] = []
        # Let Copilot suggest the implementation
```

## üí° Copilot Usage Tips

### 1. Context Setup
Create `.copilot/instructions.md`:
```markdown
# Code Review Assistant Project

## Goal
Build a comprehensive code review tool that helps developers write better code.

## Key Features
- Multi-language support (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript)
- Real-time analysis during development
- Integration with popular IDEs
- Team collaboration features

## Quality Standards
- 90%+ test coverage
- Sub-second analysis for single files
- Clear, actionable suggestions
- Minimal false positives
```

### 2. Pattern Library
Build a pattern library with Copilot:
```python
# Common code smells to detect
# Let Copilot generate implementations

def detect_long_methods(code: str) -> List[CodeIssue]:
    """Detect methods longer than 20 lines."""
    # Copilot will suggest AST parsing approach

def detect_duplicate_code(files: List[Path]) -> List[CodeIssue]:
    """Find duplicate code blocks across files."""
    # Copilot will suggest similarity algorithms
```

### 3. Multi-File Context
```python
# Use Copilot's multi-file awareness
# Open these files together:
# - analyzers/python_analyzer.py
# - analyzers/javascript_analyzer.py
# - core/issue_formatter.py

# Copilot will maintain consistency across analyzers
```

## üéØ Challenge Levels

### üü¢ Basic Level
- Single file analysis
- Basic pattern detection (long methods, complex conditions)
- Console output
- Support for Python only

### üü° Intermediate Level
- Multi-file project analysis
- Advanced patterns (SOLID violations, design patterns)
- Web dashboard
- Python and JavaScript support

### üî¥ Advanced Level
- Real-time IDE integration
- AI-powered suggestions using LLMs
- Team collaboration features
- Support for 5+ languages
- Git integration for PR reviews
