# Effective Prompts Guia

Learn how to craft effective prompts for AI applications to get the best results from your AI models.

## Introdução

Writing effective prompts is crucial for getting high-quality responses from AI models. This guide will help you understand the principles and best practices for prompt engineering.

## Key Principles

### 1. Be Clear and Specific

- **Define the task clearly**: Tell the AI exactly what you want it to do
- **Provide context**: Give relevant background information
- **Specify the format**: Describe how you want the output structured

### 2. Use Examples (Few-Shot Learning)

Providing examples helps the AI understand the pattern you're looking for:

```
Task: Classify the sentiment of these reviews as positive or negative.

Example 1: "This product is amazing!" → Positive
Example 2: "Terrible quality, very disappointed." → Negative

Now classify: "Pretty good for the price."
```

### 3. Break Down Complex Tarefas

For complex requests, break them into steps:

```
1. First, analyze the problem
2. Then, identify possible solutions
3. Finally, recommend the best approach with reasoning
```

## Common Prompt Patterns

### Role-Based Prompts

```
You are an expert software architect. Review this code and suggest improvements for scalability.
```

### Constraint-Based Prompts

```
Explain quantum computing in simple terms that a 10-year-old could understand, using no more than 100 words.
```

### Format-Specific Prompts

```
Provide your response in the following format:
- Summary: [brief overview]
- Key Points: [bullet list]
- Recommendations: [numbered list]
```

## Melhores Práticas

1. **Iterate and refine**: Start simple and add details as needed
2. **Test variations**: Try different phrasings to see what works best
3. **Include edge cases**: Consider how your prompt handles unusual inputs
4. **Avoid ambiguity**: Be explicit about what you want
5. **Use positive instructions**: Say what to do rather than what not to do

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Vague instructions**: "Make it better" vs. "Improve readability by adding comments"
- **Conflicting requirements**: Ensure your constraints don't contradict
- **Assuming context**: Provide all necessary information explicitly
- **Overly complex prompts**: Keep it as simple as possible

## Examples for Different Use Cases

### Code Generation

```
Write a Python function that:
- Takes a list of integers as input
- Returns the second largest number
- Handles edge cases (empty list, single element, duplicates)
- Include docstring and type hints
```

### Data Analysis

```
Analyze this sales data and provide:
1. Top 3 performing products by revenue
2. Month-over-month growth rate
3. Seasonal trends
Present findings in a clear, executive-friendly format.
```

### Creative Writing

```
Write a short story (200 words) about a robot learning to paint. Include:
- A clear beginning, middle, and end
- Emotional depth
- Vivid sensory details
- A surprising twist
```

## Avançado Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

```
Solve this step-by-step:
Problem: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, and then 180 miles in 3 hours, what is its average speed?

Let's think through this:
1. First segment: [your calculation]
2. Second segment: [your calculation]
3. Total distance: [your calculation]
4. Total time: [your calculation]
5. Average speed: [your calculation]
```

### Self-Consistency

Ask the AI to approach the problem multiple ways and compare results for better accuracy.

## Testing Your Prompts

1. **Edge case testing**: Try unusual or extreme inputs
2. **Consistency checking**: Run the same prompt multiple times
3. **User testing**: Have others try your prompts
4. **Performance metrics**: Measure accuracy, relevance, and usefulness

## Conclusão

Effective prompt engineering is both an art and a science. With practice and experimentation, you'll develop an intuition for what works best for your specific use cases. Remember to iterate, test, and refine your prompts based on the results you get.
