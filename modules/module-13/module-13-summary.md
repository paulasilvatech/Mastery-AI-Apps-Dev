# Module 13: Infrastructure as Code - Complete Summary

## 📚 Module Overview

Module 13 teaches you to master Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, Azure Bicep, and GitOps automation patterns. This advanced module transforms how you think about and manage cloud infrastructure.

### What You've Built

Through three progressive exercises, you've created:

1. **Exercise 1 (Bicep Basics)** ⭐
   - Complete web application infrastructure
   - Parameterized templates for multiple environments
   - Enhanced features including monitoring and security

2. **Exercise 2 (Terraform Multi-Environment)** ⭐⭐
   - Modular Terraform configuration
   - Remote state management
   - Environment-specific deployments (dev/staging/prod)

3. **Exercise 3 (GitOps Pipeline)** ⭐⭐⭐
   - Complete CI/CD pipeline for IaC
   - Policy validation and security scanning
   - Automated deployment with rollback capabilities

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

### Technical Skills Mastered

✅ **Infrastructure as Code Fundamentals**
- Declarative vs imperative approaches
- State management concepts
- Version control for infrastructure

✅ **Azure Bicep Proficiency**
- Template syntax and structure
- Parameterization and conditions
- Module composition

✅ **Terraform Expertise**
- Provider configuration
- Module development
- Multi-environment management

✅ **GitOps Implementation**
- Automated workflows
- Policy as code
- Drift detection

✅ **AI-Assisted Development**
- Using Copilot for IaC generation
- Prompt engineering for infrastructure
- Debugging with AI assistance

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns Learned

### 1. Environment Segregation
```
environments/
├── dev/       # Rapid iteration, cost-optimized
├── staging/   # Production mirror, testing
└── prod/      # High availability, security
```

### 2. Module Reusability
```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "./modules/network"
  # Reusable across all environments
}
```

### 3. GitOps Flow
```
Code → PR → Validate → Merge → Deploy → Monitor
         ↑                              ↓
         └──────── Rollback ←──────────┘
```

## 💡 Best Practices Applied
