## üìã Scenario

Your e-commerce platform has grown to:
- 10M+ products across 50K categories
- 5M+ active users generating 100K orders/day
- 500M+ events per day (views, clicks, carts)
- Need for real-time personalization
- Requirement for ML-powered recommendations
- Compliance needs for data retention

You must build an analytics system that provides real-time insights while maintaining performance.

## üî® Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Design Multi-Database Architecture (15 minutes)

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Design a multi-database architecture with:
# - PostgreSQL for transactional data and OLAP
# - Redis for real-time counters and leaderboards
# - Cosmos DB for user events and vector search
# - TimescaleDB extension for time-series
# Include data flow diagrams and sync strategies
# Handle eventual consistency properly
```

Architecture components:
1. **PostgreSQL**: Core business data, complex queries
2. **Redis**: Real-time metrics, session data, caching
3. **Cosmos DB**: Event store, vector embeddings
4. **Message Queue**: Event streaming between systems

### Step 2: Implement Vector Search for Recommendations (15 minutes)

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Create a product recommendation system using:
# - Product embeddings from descriptions/features
# - User behavior embeddings from events
# - pgvector for PostgreSQL vector operations
# - Cosmos DB vector search for scale
# Implement:
# - Embedding generation pipeline
# - Similarity search with filters
# - Hybrid search (vector + traditional)
# - Real-time embedding updates
```

Key implementations:
```python
# Example structure
class ProductEmbedding:
    """Generate and store product embeddings"""
    
    def generate_embedding(self, product):
        # Use AI model to create embeddings
        pass
    
    def find_similar(self, product_id, filters=None):
        # Vector similarity search
        pass
    
    def hybrid_search(self, text_query, vector_query):
        # Combine text and vector search
        pass
```

### Step 3: Build Real-time Analytics Pipeline (15 minutes)

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Create real-time analytics pipeline that:
# - Captures events via Kafka/Redis Streams
# - Processes with sliding windows (1min, 5min, 1hour)
# - Updates materialized views incrementally
# - Handles late-arriving events
# - Provides exactly-once semantics
# Include:
# - Event schema validation
# - Stream processing logic
# - Aggregation functions
# - State management
```

Analytics to implement:
1. **Real-time Sales**: Revenue by category/region
2. **User Behavior**: Funnel analysis, cohorts
3. **Inventory**: Stock predictions, reorder alerts
4. **Performance**: API latency, error rates

### Step 4: Implement Time-Series Analytics (10 minutes)

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```sql
-- Create TimescaleDB hypertables for:
-- 1. Sales metrics (1-minute buckets)
-- 2. User events (raw storage)
-- 3. System metrics (5-second intervals)
-- Include:
-- - Continuous aggregates
-- - Data retention policies
-- - Compression settings
-- - Partition strategies
```

Time-series queries to optimize:
- Rolling averages for trend analysis
- Anomaly detection with statistical functions
- Seasonal decomposition for forecasting
- Gap filling for missing data

### Step 5: Create Advanced Aggregations (15 minutes)

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Implement complex aggregations:
# 1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation
# 2. RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation
# 3. Market basket analysis for cross-selling
# 4. Cohort retention analysis
# 5. Attribution modeling for marketing
# Use:
# - Window functions for running totals
# - CTEs for complex calculations
# - Materialized views for performance
# - Incremental refresh strategies
```

Example implementation:
```sql
-- Customer Lifetime Value with predictive component
WITH customer_history AS (
    -- Historical purchase data
),
customer_segments AS (
    -- RFM segmentation
),
predicted_value AS (
    -- ML model predictions
)
SELECT * FROM calculated_clv;
```

### Step 6: Optimize for Scale (10 minutes)

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Implement scaling strategies:
# 1. Partition large tables by date/region
# 2. Implement read replicas with lag monitoring
# 3. Use connection pooling with PgBouncer
# 4. Cache warming for dashboards
# 5. Query result caching with invalidation
# 6. Horizontal sharding for user data
# Include monitoring and automatic failover
```

### Step 7: Build Analytics API (10 minutes)

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Create FastAPI analytics service with:
# - REST endpoints for all metrics
# - GraphQL for flexible queries
# - WebSocket for real-time updates
# - Rate limiting per user/endpoint
# - Response caching with ETags
# - Prometheus metrics export
# Features:
# - Pagination for large datasets
# - Filtering and aggregation options
# - Export to CSV/JSON
# - API key authentication
```

## üß™ Performance Validation

Create comprehensive tests:

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Create tests that validate:
# 1. Analytics queries complete in Less than 100ms
# 2. Real-time updates lag Less than 1 second
# 3. System handles 1M events/minute
# 4. Vector search returns in Less than 50ms
# 5. Aggregations are accurate
# 6. Cache invalidation works correctly
# Use pytest with async support and fixtures
```

Load testing scenarios:
```python
# Simulate realistic load
- 10K concurrent dashboard users
- 100K events per second
- 1K vector searches per second
- Continuous data ingestion
```

## üìä Implementation Example

```python
# Real-time sales analytics
class RealTimeAnalytics:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pg_pool = PostgreSQLPool()
        self.redis = RedisCluster()
        self.cosmos = CosmosClient()
    
    async def get_sales_metrics(self, timeframe='1h'):
        """Get real-time sales metrics with caching"""
        cache_key = f"sales:{timeframe}:{datetime.now().minute}"
        
        # Try cache first
        cached = await self.redis.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            return json.loads(cached)
        
        # Query optimized view
        query = """
        SELECT 
            time_bucket('1 minute', created_at) as minute,
            category_id,
            SUM(total) as revenue,
            COUNT(*) as order_count,
            AVG(total) as avg_order_value
        FROM orders_realtime
        WHERE created_at &gt; NOW() - INTERVAL %s
        GROUP BY 1, 2
        ORDER BY 1 DESC
        """
        
        results = await self.pg_pool.fetch(query, timeframe)
        
        # Cache for 30 seconds
        await self.redis.setex(cache_key, 30, json.dumps(results))
        
        return results
```
