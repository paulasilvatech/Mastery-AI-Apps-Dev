# Exercise 1: AI-Powered COBOL Analyzer (⭐ Easy - 30 minutes)

## 🎯 Objective
Build an AI-powered system that analyzes COBOL code, identifies patterns, complexity metrics, and suggests modernization strategies using natural language processing.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn
- COBOL program structure and syntax
- Static code analysis techniques
- AI-powered pattern recognition
- Complexity metrics calculation
- Modernization opportunity identification
- Documentation generation

## 📋 Prerequisites
- COBOL compiler installed (GnuCOBOL)
- Python environment set up
- OpenAI API key configured
- Basic understanding of COBOL structure

## 📚 Background

COBOL programs often contain decades of business logic that needs careful analysis before modernization. Manual analysis is time-consuming and error-prone. AI can help by:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common COBOL patterns and anti-patterns
- **Complexity Analysis**: Measuring cyclomatic complexity and maintainability
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understanding program interconnections
- **Documentation**: Generating missing documentation from code
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying high-risk areas for modernization

## 🏗️ Analyzer Architecture

The analyzer consists of several components:

1. **COBOL Parser** - Tokenizes and builds AST from COBOL source
2. **Metrics Calculator** - Computes complexity and maintainability metrics
3. **AI Analyzer** - Uses GPT-4 to understand business logic
4. **Report Generator** - Creates comprehensive analysis reports

## 📚 Exercise Structure

This exercise is divided into 3 parts:

### [Part 1: Foundation](./exercise1-part1.md)
- Set up the COBOL parser
- Implement basic metrics calculation
- Create initial analysis structure

### [Part 2: Enhancement](./exercise1-part2.md)
- Add AI-powered analysis
- Implement pattern detection
- Generate modernization suggestions

### [Part 3: Polish](./exercise1-part3.md)
- Create comprehensive reports
- Add visualization
- Test with real COBOL programs

## 🎯 Success Criteria

You'll know you've successfully completed this exercise when:
- [ ] Parser can analyze COBOL programs
- [ ] Metrics are calculated correctly
- [ ] AI provides meaningful insights
- [ ] Reports are comprehensive and actionable
- [ ] Tool works with real legacy code

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start small** - Test with simple COBOL programs first
2. **Use AI wisely** - Let GPT-4 help understand business logic
3. **Focus on value** - Prioritize actionable insights
4. **Test thoroughly** - Validate with various COBOL patterns
