## 📚 Key Concepts

### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Context Analysis** - Copilot reads your current file and related files
2. **Pattern Recognition** - It identifies coding patterns and conventions
3. **Suggestion Generation** - AI generates contextually relevant code
4. **Continuous Learning** - It adapts to your coding style

### Core Features

- **Code Completion** - Suggests next lines as you type
- **Function Generation** - Creates entire functions from comments
- **Pattern Recognition** - Learns from your codebase
- **Multi-Language Support** - Works with dozens of languages
- **Context Awareness** - Understands project structure

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Verify Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.11+
   code --version    # VS Code installed
   gh copilot status # Copilot active
   ```

2. **Clone Module Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/workshop/mastery-ai-development.git
   cd mastery-ai-development/modules/module-01-introduction
   ```

3. **Open in VS Code**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. **Start with Exercise 1**
   ```bash
   cd exercises/exercise1-easy
   ```

## 📝 Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: First AI Code (⭐ Easy)
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes

## 🎨 Copilot Prompt Examples

### Example 1: Simple Function
```python
# Create a function that validates email addresses
# It should check for @ symbol and domain
# Return True if valid, False otherwise

# Copilot will generate the complete function
```

### Example 2: Class Generation
```python
# Create a User class with:
# - Properties: name, email, age, created_at
# - Methods: validate_email, calculate_age, to_dict
# - Include type hints and docstrings

# Copilot will create the entire class
```

### Example 3: Algorithm Implementation
```python
# Implement binary search algorithm
# Input: sorted list of numbers and target value
# Return: index of target or -1 if not found
# Include edge case handling

# Copilot will provide optimized implementation
```
