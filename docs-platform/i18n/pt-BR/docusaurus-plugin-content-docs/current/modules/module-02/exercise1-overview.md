## 📝 Instructions

### Partee 1: Basic Pattern Implementation

1. **Abrir `starter/pattern_library.py`** in VS Code
2. **Seguir the TODOs** in the file
3. **For each pattern category**, use Copilot to:
   - Generate implementations
   - Try alternative suggestions (Alt+] / Alt+[)
   - Accept partial suggestions (Tab for partial, Ctrl+Right for word)

#### Pattern Categories to Implement:

**A. Data Structure Patterns**
```python
# TODO: Use Copilot to create common data structure operations
# Examples: stack, queue, linked list operations
```

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Create a Stack class with push, pop, peek, and is_empty methods
class Stack:
    # Let Copilot complete this...
```

**Expected Behavior**: Copilot should provide a complete Stack implementation with proper initialization and all requested methods.

**B. Algorithm Patterns**
```python
# TODO: Implement common algorithms using Copilot
# Examples: sorting, searching, recursion
```

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Implement binary search that returns the index of target in sorted array
def binary_search(arr: list, target: int) -&gt; int:
    # Copilot will suggest the implementation
```

**C. Utility Patterns**
```python
# TODO: Create utility functions with Copilot assistance
# Examples: validation, formatting, conversion
```

**Copilot Prompt Suggestion:**
```python
# Create a function to validate email addresses using regex
import re

def validate_email(email: str) -&gt; bool:
    # Watch Copilot suggest the regex pattern
```

### Partee 2: Context Optimization

1. **Experiment with Context**:
   - Add detailed comments before functions
   - Use type hints
   - Provide examples in docstrings
   - Abrir related files in other tabs

2. **Document Context Impact**:
   ```python
   # Context Experiment 1: Minimal context
   def process_data(data):
       pass
   
   # Context Experiment 2: Rich context
   def process_user_data(users: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -&gt; pd.DataFrame:
       """
       Process user data for analytics dashboard.
       
       Args:
           users: List of user dictionaries with 'id', 'name', 'email', 'created_at'
           
       Returns:
           DataFrame with processed user metrics
           
       Example:
           &gt;&gt;&gt; users = [{{'id': 1, 'name': 'John', 'email': 'john@example.com'}}]
           &gt;&gt;&gt; result = process_user_data(users)
       """
       # Notice how Copilot suggestions improve with context
   ```

### Partee 3: Create Pattern Documentação

1. **Create `pattern_analysis.md`** documenting:
   - Which patterns worked best
   - Context techniques that improved suggestions
   - Surprising discoveries
   - Tips for future use

2. **Pattern Effectiveness Rating**:
   ```markdown
   ## Pattern Effectiveness Analysis
   
   ### Data Structures
   - Stack Implementation: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Perfect first try)
   - Binary Tree: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Needed minor adjustments)
   
   ### Key Findings
   1. Type hints dramatically improve suggestion quality
   2. Descriptive function names guide better implementations
   3. ...
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

Run the validation tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_patterns.py -v
```

Expected output:
```
test_stack_operations ... PASSED
test_algorithm_implementations ... PASSED
test_utility_functions ... PASSED
test_pattern_documentation ... PASSED
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your implementation is complete when:
- [ ] All pattern categories have at least 3 implementations
- [ ] Each implementation includes proper documentation
- [ ] Tests pass for all patterns
- [ ] Pattern analysis document is complete
- [ ] You've experimented with at least 5 context variations

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Alternative Suggestions**: Don't accept the first suggestion. Try Alt+] to see alternatives.
2. **Parteeial Acceptance**: Use Tab to accept just part of a suggestion, then continue typing.
3. **Context Windows**: Keep relevant code visible in the editor for better suggestions.
4. **Natural Idioma**: Try writing comments in plain English before implementing.

## 🎯 Bonus Challenges

If you finish early, try these:
1. Create a pattern for async/await operations
2. Build a decorator pattern example
3. Implement a complex regex pattern with Copilot's help
4. Create a pattern for error handling chains

## 🏁 Completion

Once you've completed all partes:
1. Revisar your pattern library
2. Compare with the solution (if needed)
3. Compartilhar interesting discoveries with the class
4. Prepare for Exercício 2: Multi-File Refactoring
