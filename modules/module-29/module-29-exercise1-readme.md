## 🎯 Success Criteria

Your implementation should:

- ✅ Support multiple tenants with complete data isolation
- ✅ Implement all CRUD operations with proper validation
- ✅ Include AI-powered features using Semantic Kernel
- ✅ Have comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Pass all provided unit and integration tests
- ✅ Achieve <100ms response time for basic operations
- ✅ Handle 1000+ concurrent requests
- ✅ Score A+ on security headers test

## 💡 Implementation Tips

### Multi-Tenancy Strategy
- Use a hybrid approach: shared database with tenant column
- Implement row-level security through EF Core global filters
- Cache tenant configuration aggressively

### AI Integration
- Initialize Semantic Kernel once per tenant
- Use background services for heavy AI operations
- Implement circuit breakers for AI service calls

### Performance Optimization
- Use projection for read operations
- Implement response caching with tenant awareness
- Use bulk operations for data imports

### Security Considerations
- Validate tenant context on every request
- Implement proper JWT validation
- Use Azure Key Vault for secrets

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### Unit Tests
```bash
cd tests/EnterpriseAPI.UnitTests
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
cd tests/EnterpriseAPI.IntegrationTests
dotnet test
```

### Load Testing
```bash
# Using k6
k6 run tests/performance/load-test.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. Import Postman collection from `assets/postman-collection.json`
2. Set environment variables for tenant contexts
3. Run through all scenarios
