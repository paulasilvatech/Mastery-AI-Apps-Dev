### Development Process

#### Week 1: Planning & Setup
1. **Choose your project** from ideas or create your own
2. **Define requirements** clearly
3. **Create project structure**
4. **Set up Git repository**
5. **Write initial README**

#### Week 2: Core Development
1. **Build core features** with Copilot
2. **Implement data persistence**
3. **Add error handling**
4. **Create user interface**
5. **Write tests**

#### Week 3: Polish & Deploy

   - What you'd do differently

### Example Showcase

Here's an example structure for the Smart Journal project:

```python
# smart_journal.py - Main application file
"""
Smart Journal - AI-Enhanced Personal Journaling
An independent project for Module 01 of Mastery AI Code Development Workshop

Features:
- Natural language journal entries
- Mood analysis and tracking
- AI-generated writing prompts
- Entry summarization
- Pattern recognition
"""

import datetime
import json
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
from pathlib import Path

class SmartJournal:
    def __init__(self, data_path: str = "journal_data"):
        self.data_path = Path(data_path)
        self.data_path.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
        self.entries = self.load_entries()
    
    def add_entry(self, content: str, mood: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict:
        """Add a new journal entry with automatic mood detection"""
        # TODO: Use Copilot to implement
        pass
    
    def analyze_mood(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Analyze mood from journal entry text"""
        # TODO: Implement mood analysis
        pass
    
    def generate_prompt(self, mood: str = None, topic: str = None) -> str:
        """Generate a writing prompt based on mood or topic"""
        # TODO: Create contextual prompts
        pass
    
    def summarize_period(self, days: int = 7) -> str:
        """Summarize journal entries from the past N days"""
        # TODO: Generate summary
        pass
    
    def find_patterns(self) -> List[str]:
        """Identify patterns in journal entries"""
        # TODO: Pattern recognition
        pass
```

### Success Tips

1. **Start Small**: Build MVP first, then add features
2. **Use Copilot Wisely**: Let it help, but understand the code
3. **Test Everything**: Write tests as you develop
4. **Document Early**: Don't leave docs for last
5. **Get Feedback**: Share with peers for input
6. **Have Fun**: Choose a project you're passionate about

### Sharing Your Project

Once complete, share your project:
- Post in workshop Discord channel
- Create a GitHub discussion
- Write a blog post about your experience
- Record a demo video
- Submit to workshop showcase
