# Module 21: Introduction to AI Agents

## üéØ Module Overview

Welcome to Module 21! This module marks the beginning of the AI Agents & MCP Track, where you'll dive deep into the world of AI agents. You'll understand agent architectures, master GitHub Copilot agent features, and create your first autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks independently.

### Duration
- **Total Time**: 3 hours
- **Lecture/Demo**: 45 minutes
- **Hands-on Exercises**: 2 hours 15 minutes

### Track
- üü£ AI Agents & MCP Track (Modules 21-25)

## üéì Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Understand Agent Architectures** - Master different agent patterns and their use cases
2. **Master GitHub Copilot Agents** - Leverage Copilot's agent capabilities effectively
3. **Create Simple Autonomous Agents** - Build agents that can work independently
4. **Implement Tool-Calling Patterns** - Enable agents to use external tools and APIs
5. **Design Agent Communication Flows** - Create effective agent interaction patterns

## üîß Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Completed Modules 1-20
- ‚úÖ Strong Python programming skills
- ‚úÖ Understanding of async programming concepts
- ‚úÖ Experience with REST APIs
- ‚úÖ GitHub Copilot subscription active

See [prerequisites.md](prerequisites.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## üìö Key Concepts

### What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are autonomous systems that can:
- **Perceive**: Understand their environment and context
- **Reason**: Make decisions based on goals and constraints
- **Act**: Execute actions to achieve objectives
- **Learn**: Improve performance over time
