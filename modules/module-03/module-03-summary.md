## 📚 Key Concepts Mastered

### 1. Context Window Optimization
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Imports (Type hints)   │ ← Establishes capabilities
├─────────────────────────┤
│  Class Definitions      │ ← Shows data structures  
├─────────────────────────┤
│  Related Functions      │ ← Demonstrates patterns
├─────────────────────────┤
│  YOUR PROMPT HERE ▼     │ ← Copilot has full context
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Effective Prompt Formula
```
[CONTEXT] + [INTENT] + [CONSTRAINTS] + [EXAMPLES] = Great Code
```

### 3. Pattern Categories
- **Structural**: Code organization patterns
- **Behavioral**: Functionality patterns
- **Creational**: Component generation
- **Validation**: Correctness patterns
- **Optimization**: Performance patterns

## 💡 Top 10 Prompting Best Practices

1. **Be Specific** - Vague prompts yield vague code
2. **Provide Context** - Help Copilot understand the bigger picture
3. **Show Examples** - Demonstrate input/output relationships
4. **State Constraints** - Be explicit about requirements
5. **Use Type Hints** - Always include type information
6. **Group Related Code** - Keep similar functions together
7. **Comment Strategically** - Guide without over-commenting
8. **Establish Patterns** - Show 2-3 examples before expecting pattern following
9. **Iterate Quickly** - Refine prompts based on results
10. **Verify Output** - Always review and test generated code

## 🛠️ Practical Techniques

### Context Optimization Checklist
