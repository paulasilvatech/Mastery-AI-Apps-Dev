# Module 20: Production Deployment Strategies

## 🎯 Module Overview

Welcome to Module 20! In this advanced enterprise module, you'll master production deployment strategies that enable safe, reliable, and fast releases at scale. You'll implement blue-green deployments, canary releases, and feature flags using GitHub Copilot to accelerate your development.

**Duration**: 3 hours  
**Difficulty**: 🔴 Enterprise  
**Track**: Enterprise (Modules 16-20)

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Master Blue-Green Deployments**: Implement zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback
2. **Implement Canary Releases**: Gradually roll out changes with automated metrics monitoring
3. **Build Feature Flag Systems**: Control feature exposure with runtime configuration
4. **Design Progressive Delivery**: Combine multiple strategies for complex deployments
5. **Automate Deployment Pipelines**: Use GitHub Actions for orchestration
6. **Monitor Production Health**: Implement comprehensive observability

## 🏗️ What You'll Build

Throughout this module, you'll create:
