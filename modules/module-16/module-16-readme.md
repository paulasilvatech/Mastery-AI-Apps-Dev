# Module 16: Security Implementation

## üéØ Module Overview

Welcome to Module 16! This module delivers comprehensive enterprise security implementation using Zero Trust principles, advanced encryption techniques, and compliance frameworks. You'll learn to build secure, compliant systems that protect data, users, and infrastructure while enabling AI-powered development workflows.

### Duration
- **Total Time**: 3 hours
- **Lecture/Demo**: 45 minutes
- **Hands-on Exercises**: 2 hours 15 minutes

### Track
- üî¥ Enterprise Track (Modules 16-20)

## üéì Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Implement Zero Trust Architecture** - Design and deploy systems with "never trust, always verify" principles
2. **Apply Advanced Encryption** - Secure data at rest, in transit, and in use with modern cryptographic techniques
3. **Ensure Compliance** - Meet regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2) through automated controls
4. **Secure AI Workloads** - Protect AI models, prompts, and outputs from security threats
5. **Build Secure CI/CD Pipelines** - Implement security scanning, vulnerability management, and secure deployments

## üîß Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Completed Modules 1-15
- ‚úÖ Understanding of cloud architecture patterns
- ‚úÖ Basic security concepts (authentication, authorization)
- ‚úÖ Azure subscription with security services enabled
- ‚úÖ GitHub Advanced Security access

See [prerequisites.md](prerequisites.md) for detailed setup instructions.
