# Module 12: Cloud-Native Development 🟠 Advanced

## Overview

Master cloud-native development patterns using containers, Kubernetes, and serverless architectures. This module transforms you from traditional application developer to cloud-native architect, leveraging GitHub Copilot to accelerate container creation, Kubernetes manifest generation, and serverless function development.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

1. **Containerize applications** with Docker using AI-assisted Dockerfile creation
2. **Deploy to Kubernetes** with GitHub Copilot-generated manifests
3. **Build serverless functions** for Azure Functions with AI optimization
4. **Implement microservices patterns** with service mesh and API gateway
5. **Create cloud-native CI/CD pipelines** with GitHub Actions
6. **Monitor and scale** cloud-native applications effectively
