## üí° Prompt Optimization Tips

### 1. Be Specific About Types
```python
# ‚ùå Vague
# Create a function that processes data

# ‚úÖ Specific
# Create a function that processes a list of dictionaries containing 
# user data (id: int, name: str, email: str) and returns 
# a dictionary mapping user IDs to email addresses
```

### 2. Include Examples
```python
# Process log entries and extract error information
# Input example: "2024-01-15 10:30:45 ERROR Database connection failed"
# Output example: {"timestamp": "2024-01-15 10:30:45", "level": "ERROR", "message": "Database connection failed"}
```

### 3. Specify Error Handling
```python
# Create a file parser that:
# - Handles missing files gracefully (return None)
# - Validates file format (raise ValueError for invalid format)
# - Manages large files efficiently (stream processing)
# - Logs warnings for recoverable issues
```

### 4. Chain Complex Tasks
```python
# Step 1: Create a data validator class
# Step 2: Add methods for each validation rule
# Step 3: Implement custom error messages
# Step 4: Add configuration support
# Step 5: Create comprehensive tests
```

## üéØ Context-Specific Templates

### CLI Application
```python
# Create a CLI command that [action] with:
# - Arguments: [positional args with types]
# - Options: [--flag descriptions and defaults]
# - Help text: [user-friendly descriptions]
# - Output format: [human-readable/json/csv]
# - Error messages: [clear user guidance]
# Use: click/argparse with proper styling
```

### Web API
```python
# Create a REST endpoint that [action] with:
# - Route: [HTTP method and path]
# - Request body: [expected JSON schema]
# - Query parameters: [optional filters]
# - Response: [success and error formats]
# - Authentication: [required auth method]

# - Ensures single instance across application
# - Lazy initialization
# - Thread-safe in multi-threaded environment
# - Allows configuration on first creation
```

### Factory Pattern
```python
# Create a factory for [ProductType] that:
# - Creates different types based on [criteria]
