# Exercise 1: Rapid Todo App - Enhanced Guide (45 minutes)

## üéØ Overview

Build a functional todo application using two approaches with GitHub Copilot:
- **Code Suggestion Mode**: Use inline comments to generate code
- **Agent Mode**: Use comprehensive prompts for complete implementations

## ü§ñ Understanding the Two Approaches

### Code Suggestion Mode
- **What it is**: GitHub Copilot suggests code as you type based on comments and context
- **Best for**: Line-by-line development, learning syntax, incremental building
- **How it works**: Write a comment, press Tab to accept suggestions

### Agent Mode (Copilot Chat)
- **What it is**: Conversational AI that generates complete code blocks and files
- **Best for**: Rapid prototyping, complex implementations, architectural decisions
- **How it works**: Write detailed prompts in chat, get comprehensive solutions

## üìã Prerequisites Check

### Using Agent Mode for Setup Verification

```markdown
# Copilot Agent Prompt:

1. System Requirements:
   - Python 3.11+ with pip
   - Node.js 18+ with npm
   - Git installed and configured
   - Azure CLI (for deployment)
   - VS Code with GitHub Copilot

2. Required Accounts:
   - GitHub account with Copilot enabled
   - Azure subscription (free tier works)
   - Verify Copilot is working

3. Port Availability:
   - Check ports 8000 and 5173 are free

4. Create Setup Script:
   - Cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)
   - Colored output for status
   - Install missing dependencies
   - Setup virtual environment
   - Configure Azure CLI

Include error handling and helpful messages for each check.
```

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Project Setup (5 minutes)

#### Option A: Code Suggestion Approach
```bash
# In your terminal, create the project structure
mkdir -p todo-app/{backend,frontend}
cd todo-app

# Backend setup - let Copilot help with each file
cd backend
# Create a comment in terminal or new file:
# Create requirements.txt for FastAPI todo app with SQLAlchemy
```

#### Option B: Agent Mode Approach
```markdown
# Copilot Agent Prompt:
Create a complete project structure for a todo app:

Project Requirements:
- Root folder: todo-app
- Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, SQLite, CORS support
- Frontend: React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, Axios
- Create all necessary files:
  - backend/requirements.txt (fastapi, uvicorn, sqlalchemy, pydantic)
  - backend/main.py (starter template)
  - frontend/package.json (with all dependencies)
  - frontend/vite.config.js (with proxy configuration)
  - frontend/tailwind.config.js
  - .gitignore for both Python and Node.js

Include setup commands for both environments.
```

**üí° Exploration Tip**: Try adding Docker support to your project structure! Modify the prompt to include Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.

### Step 2: Backend API Implementation (10 minutes)

#### Option A: Code Suggestion Approach

Create `backend/main.py` and build incrementally:

```python
# Create a FastAPI app for todo management
# Import necessary modules: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
# Let Copilot suggest the imports...

# Create database models for todos
# Todo should have: id, title, completed status
```

Build step by step:
1. Write a comment for each component
2. Accept Copilot suggestions
3. Refine as needed

#### Option B: Agent Mode Approach

```markdown
# Copilot Agent Prompt:
Create a complete FastAPI backend for a todo app in main.py:

Technical Requirements:
1. Database:
   - Use SQLAlchemy with SQLite
   - Todo model: id (int), title (str), completed (bool), created_at (datetime)
   - In-memory database for development

2. API Endpoints:
   - GET /todos - List all todos with optional filtering
   - POST /todos - Create new todo with validation
   - PUT /todos/{id} - Update todo (title or completed)
   - DELETE /todos/{id} - Soft delete with is_deleted flag
   - GET /todos/stats - Return statistics

3. Features:
   - CORS enabled for localhost:5173
   - Request validation with Pydantic
   - Proper error handling with status codes

// - Functions to add, toggle, and delete todos
// - Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
// Let Copilot complete the imports...

function App() {
  // State management for todos
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([])
  // Let Copilot suggest more state...
```

#### Option B: Agent Mode Approach

```markdown
# Copilot Agent Prompt:
Create a complete React todo app with modern UI/UX:

Component Structure:
1. Main App Component:
   - State management with useState and useReducer
   - API integration with custom hooks
   - Error boundary for graceful failures

2. Sub-components to create:
   - TodoList: Virtual scrolling for performance
