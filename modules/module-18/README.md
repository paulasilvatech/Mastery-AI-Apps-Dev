## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Tips for This Module

### Effective Prompts for Integration Patterns

1. **For ESB Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Create a message router that:
   # - Routes based on message type and content
   # - Transforms between different formats (JSON, XML, Avro)
   # - Implements retry with exponential backoff
   # - Handles poison messages
   # - Tracks message flow with correlation IDs
   ```

2. **For CQRS Design**:
   ```python
   # Implement CQRS pattern with:
   # - Separate command and query interfaces
   # - Command validation and authorization
   # - Async command processing
   # - Read model projections
   # - Consistency boundaries
   ```

3. **For Saga Implementation**:
   ```python
   # Build a saga orchestrator that:
   # - Manages multi-step transactions
   # - Implements compensating actions
   # - Handles timeouts and retries
   # - Persists saga state
   # - Provides observability
   ```

## 📊 Success Metrics
