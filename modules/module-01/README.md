## 📚 Module Content

### Part 1: Understanding AI-Powered Development (45 minutes)

#### What is GitHub Copilot?
GitHub Copilot is your AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It draws context from comments and code to suggest individual lines and whole functions instantly.

#### How Does It Work?
