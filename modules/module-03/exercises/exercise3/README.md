## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Environment Setup

```bash
# Navigate to exercise directory
cd exercises/exercise3-hard

# Install additional dependencies
pip install pydantic rich watchdog pytest-asyncio
```

### Step 2: Understand the Challenge

You're building a system that:
1. Manages custom instructions per project
2. Enforces team coding standards
3. Generates context-specific instructions
4. Validates instruction effectiveness
5. Integrates with development tools

### Step 3: Open Starter Code

```bash
code starter/
```

## 📝 Exercise Parts

### Part 1: System Architecture (20-30 minutes)
- Design the instruction system architecture
- Create configuration schemas
- Build the instruction registry
- Implement storage mechanisms

### Part 2: Core Implementation (20-30 minutes)
- Develop instruction generators
- Create validation framework
- Build team standard enforcement
- Implement context awareness

### Part 3: Advanced Features (20-30 minutes)
- Add performance monitoring
- Create IDE integrations
- Build CI/CD hooks

## 🎯 Key Components

### 1. Project Configuration

```python
@dataclass
class ProjectConfig:
    """Project-specific Copilot configuration."""
    name: str
    language: str
    framework: Optional[str]
    style_guide: str
    complexity_level: str
    domain_rules: List[str]
    custom_patterns: Dict[str, str]
    excluded_suggestions: List[str]
```

### 2. Instruction Generator

```python
class InstructionGenerator:
    """Generate custom instructions based on context."""
    
    def generate_file_instructions(self, file_path: Path) -> str:
        """Generate instructions for a specific file."""
        # Analyze file type, location, purpose
        # Apply project and team standards
        # Return customized instructions
```

### 3. Validation System

```python
class InstructionValidator:
    """Validate instruction effectiveness."""
    
    def validate_instructions(self, instructions: str) -> ValidationResult:
        """Check if instructions meet quality standards."""
        # Verify completeness
        # Check clarity
        # Ensure consistency
        # Return validation results
```
