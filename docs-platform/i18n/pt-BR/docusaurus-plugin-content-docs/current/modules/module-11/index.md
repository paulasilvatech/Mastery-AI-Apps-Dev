# Módulo 11: Microservices Architecture

## 🎯 Visão Geral do Módulo

Welcome to Módulo 11 of the Mastery AI Code Development Workshop! This module focuses on designing and implementing microservices architectures using AI-powered desenvolvimento techniques. You'll learn how to decompose monolithic applications, design service boundaries, implement inter-service communication, and handle the complexities of distributed systems.

### Duração: 3 horas
### Trilha: 🟠 Avançado
### Pré-requisitos: Módulos 1-10 Completard

## 📚 Objetivos de Aprendizagem

Ao final deste módulo, você será capaz de:

1. **Design effective microservice boundaries** using Domain-Driven Design principles
2. **Implement inter-service communication** patterns (REST, gRPC, message queues)
3. **Handle distributed transactions** using saga patterns
4. **Implement service discovery** and load balancing
5. **Design resilient systems** with circuit breakers and retry patterns
6. **Monitor and trace** distributed requests across services
7. **Use GitHub Copilot** to accelerate microservices desenvolvimento

## 📋 Exercícios Visão Geral

### Exercício 1: Foundation - Service Decomposition (⭐)
**Duração**: 30-45 minutos  
**Success Rate**: 95%

Build your first microservices system by decomposing a monolithic e-commerce application into three services: User Service, Product Service, and Order Service. Learn the fundamentals of service boundaries and REST communication.

**Key Skills**:
- Service boundary identification
- RESTful API design
- Basic inter-service communication
- Docker containerization

### Exercício 2: Application - Real-World E-Commerce Platform (⭐⭐)
**Duração**: 45-60 minutos  
**Success Rate**: 80%

Implement a complete e-commerce microservices platform with advanced patterns including API Gateway, service discovery, event-driven communication, and distributed caching.

**Key Skills**:
- API Gateway pattern
- Event-driven architecture
- Service discovery
- Caching strategies
- Async communication

### Exercício 3: Mastery - produção-Ready Financial Platform (⭐⭐⭐)
**Duração**: 60-90 minutos  
**Success Rate**: 60%

Build a produção-ready financial services platform with complete observability, security, resilience patterns, and distributed transaction handling using saga patterns.

**Key Skills**:
- Saga pattern implementation
- Circuit breakers
- Distributed tracing
- Security between services
- Performance optimization
- Chaos engineering readiness

## 🚀 Começando

1. **Revisar Pré-requisitos**

   ```

## 💡 Copilot Tips for This Módulo

1. **Service Design**: Use comments to describe business capabilities before implementing
2. **API Contracts**: Define AbrirAPI specs first, let Copilot generate implementations
3. **Error Handling**: Ask Copilot for resilience patterns specific to distributed systems
4. **Testing**: Request integration tests that handle network failures
