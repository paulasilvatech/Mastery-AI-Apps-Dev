- Set up project structure
- Create data models
- Implement basic authentication
- Set up data storage

#### Phase 2: Transaction Features (3 hours)
- Transaction CRUD operations
- Category management
- Search and filtering
- Data validation

#### Phase 3: Budget & Reports (3 hours)
- Budget creation and tracking

## 💡 Implementation Tips

### Using Copilot Effectively

1. **Start with Clear Comments**
   ```python
   # Create a Transaction class that:
   # - Stores amount, date, category, description
   # - Validates amount is positive for income, negative for expense
   # - Supports tags for detailed categorization
   # - Can calculate running balance
   # - Exports to dict for JSON serialization
   ```

2. **Build Incrementally**
   - Implement one feature at a time
   - Test each component before moving on
   - Use Copilot to generate tests alongside code

3. **Leverage Patterns from Exercises**
   - Use authentication patterns from Exercise 3
   - Apply CLI patterns from Exercise 2
   - Implement validation from Exercise 1

### Sample Code Structure

**Transaction Model Example:**
```python
from datetime import datetime
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Optional
import uuid

class TransactionType(Enum):
    INCOME = "income"
    EXPENSE = "expense"

class Transaction:
    """
    Financial transaction with categorization and validation.
    
    Use Copilot to complete the implementation with:
    - Initialization with validation
    - Category management
    - Tag support
    - JSON serialization
    - Running balance calculation
    """
    
    def __init__(self, amount: float, type: TransactionType, 
                 category: str, description: str = "",
                 date: Optional[datetime] = None):
        # Let Copilot complete this
        pass
```
